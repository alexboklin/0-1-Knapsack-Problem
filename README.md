This script takes a file that describes a knapsack instance, in the following format:
[knapsack_size][number_of_items]
[value_1] [weight_1]
[value_2] [weight_2]
...
For example, the third line of the file is "50074 659", indicating that the second item has value 50074 and size 659, respectively. 
It optionally prints out all the necessary solution info, such as what items to take and what their total value/weight would be, as well as the execution time.
